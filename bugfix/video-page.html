After getting through a tough week, Rockstar Games has now released a trailer of the GTA 5.</span></p>
<p>This trailer focuses on the three protagonists of the game, Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Michael, a middle-aged career criminal tries to make something good out of his life but is dragged back to the criminal world by best friends Franklin and Trevor, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redmondpie.com/grand-theft-auto-5-the-final-trailer-drops-ahead-of-release-video/">reported </a>Redmond Pie.</p><p class="fblike"><span>Like Us on Facebook</span> </p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto 5 is one of the most awaited games by Rockstar North and is scheduled to release on 17 September, 2013. Earlier this week, online hackers got an easy access to GTA 5, after they decrypted the PlayStation Network preload file, which was the copy of the game uploaded for all the gamers to download before the official launch. Hackers not only released the audio clips but also gave away the end of the game.</p>

<p>Though, the audio files and the end of the game were <a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.co.uk//articles/496575/20130826/spoiler-alert-hackers-reveal-ending-grand-theft.htm">leaked </a>before the launch, there are a lot of loyal fans who have patiently been waiting for the game to roll out.</p>
<p>&#xA0;Sony took an initiative to <a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.co.uk//articles/496600/20130828/sony-apologises-gta5-leaks-playstation-preorder-stopped.htm">apologise </a>to the fan base of GTA 5 and the game developers and immediately removed the link of the GTA 5 from PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>The game developers and the publishers of GTA 5, Rockstar North and Rockstar Games have made a lot of efforts to keep the fans enthusiastic about the official launch by launching screenshots of the game beforehand. Even though the launch of the game was delayed by the producers, the enthusiasm of the gamers did not die, thanks to these initiatives.</p>
<p>The open world crime game will be launched for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The GTA 4 was launched in 2008 and fans can finally lay their hands on the new edition after a four-year-wait.</p>
<p>GTA 5 is a third person shooter game set up in Southern California. The game world is composed of San Andreas countryside along with a fictional city called Los Santos inspired by Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The story is narrated by the three main characters and the players can switch in between. The game begins with the protagonists planning to execute six large fights to accumulate wealth. The game also has an addition of online multiplayer mode, which would allow up to 16 players to engage in the game play.</p>
